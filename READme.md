# Discord Music Bot

## Overview

Once inviting the bot to the respective Discord server, you can use it. The bot uses simple commands that use yt-dlp and ffmpeg to download and play it from the bot.

## Commands

**!play** *SOURCE*: The play command requires a parameter which is the video you want to use. URls are a lot easier on getting specifically what you want. If something is already playing it will add video to the queue. Non-URLs work as well, but might be a lot more unnacurrate.

**!queue** *SOURCE*: Puts video into a queue, and will play once !playnext has be used

**!skip**: Stops current song, then plays the next one. 

**!view**: Shows current queue 

**!pause**: Pauses the current song playing.

**!resume**: Resumes current song playing

**!stop**: Permanently stops song *(not the same as pause, after using this you have to use the play command again)*

# Timeline

Finished queue system, and added more commands for the bot. I want to make a file manager to make it easier for the download.

# Discord Music Bot

## Overview

Once inviting the bot to the respective Discord server, you can use it. The bot uses simple commands that use Youtube-DL and FFmpeg to download and play it from the bot.

## Commands

**!play** *SOURCE*: the play command requires a parameter which is the song you want to use. URls are a lot easier on getting specifically what you want. Non-URLs work as well, but might be a lot more unnacurrate

**!pause**: Pauses the current song playing

**!resume**: Resumes current song playing

**!stop**: Permanently stops song *(not the same as pause, after using this you have to use the play command again)*
